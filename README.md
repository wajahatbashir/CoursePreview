## How to Use

### Admin Configuration

1. Go to the **Magento Admin Panel**.
2. Navigate to **Catalog** > **Products**.
3. Edit any product.
4. You will find a section called **Course Previews** where you can upload video files or provide video URLs, along with titles and descriptions for each video.
5. You can add multiple course preview videos using the "Add Course Preview" button.

### Frontend Display

1. On the **Product Detail Page (PDP)**, you will see a button labeled **"Watch Course Review"**.
2. Clicking this button will open a popup with the video player and the list of preview videos.
3. Customers can select any video from the playlist to watch in the video player.

## Technical Details

### File Upload

- The module uses Magento's `fileUploader` component for handling video and image uploads.
- Videos are stored under the `/pub/media/course_videos/` directory.

### Video Player

- The video player on the frontend uses the native HTML5 `<video>` element.
- The playlist is dynamically rendered, and the video player updates seamlessly without page reloads.

### Controller

- The module includes a custom admin controller for handling video and image uploads.
- The controller processes the files and stores them in the appropriate media directory.

### Popup Modal

- The video player is displayed in a popup modal triggered by a button.
- The modal can only be closed by clicking the close button (`Ã—`), ensuring that the video viewing experience is not interrupted by accidental clicks outside the modal.

## System Configuration

- Navigate to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **General** > **Course Preview Configuration**.
- Enable or disable the Course Preview module from the store configuration settings.
